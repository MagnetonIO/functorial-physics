\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Functorial Physics is a rigorously defined mathematical framework that unifies quantum mechanics, general relativity, and classical field theories through category theory and topos theory. Developed in an AI-augmented, human-led workflow between October 2023 and April 2025, the framework resolves long-standing obstacles—such as the quantum/classical divide, the problem of time, and gravity–quantum compatibility—by representing physical systems as functorially related categorical structures. This position paper outlines the scientific advances, evidentiary support, and collaborative opportunities offered by Functorial Physics.
\end{abstract}

\section{Executive Summary}
Functorial Physics provides a mathematically sound, coherently structured, and computationally tractable pathway to a unified physical theory. By modelling quantum systems as objects in symmetric monoidal $*$-categories and classical spacetimes as objects in suitable topoi, the framework constructs structure-preserving functors that yield a consistent bridge between regimes.

\section{Background \& Motivation}
Existing unification attempts—such as String Theory and Loop Quantum Gravity—face challenges of background dependence, limited predictive power, or incomplete force unification. Category theory’s universality and topos theory’s generalisation of set theory supply the logical architecture Functorial Physics leverages to surmount these issues.

\section{Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Formulate a mathematically sound bridge between quantum and classical regimes.
\item Demonstrate emergent time, causality, and curvature from categorical constructions.
\item Integrate quantum error correction via derived functors.
\item Deliver a platform-ready theory suitable for computational simulation and experimental proposal.
\item Showcase the power of AI-augmented authorship.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Methodological Framework}
\subsection{Category-Theoretic Foundations}
Quantum systems are modelled as objects in symmetric monoidal $*$-categories; states correspond to morphisms, and composition encodes sequential evolution.

\subsection{Topos-Theoretic Modelling}
Classical spacetimes are represented within a topos, whose internal logic captures observer-invariant laws.

\subsection{Functorial Bridges}
A principal functor $F\colon \mathcal{Q} \to \mathcal{T}$ maps quantum categorical data to classical topoi, preserving physical invariants and enabling coherent comparison.

\subsection{Derived Functors \& Quantum Error Correction}
Derived constructions $R^nF$ encode higher-order interactions, with built-in mechanisms that replicate stabiliser codes and error mitigation schemes.

\subsection{Coherence Conditions}
Natural transformations enforce consistency across multiple functorial paths, yielding emergent spacetime curvature and ensuring unambiguous predictions.

Problem of Time & Background-dependent fixes & Time emerges from internal topos logic \\
\hline
Measurement & External collapse postulates & Treated as loss of functorial information, categorically formalised \\
\hline
Gravity/Quantum Compatibility & Perturbative / non-renormalisable & Curvature arises via categorical limits in $\mathcal{T}$ \\

\section{Comparative Analysis}
\subsection{String Theory}
Pros: mathematical richness; Cons: background dependence, limited testable predictions. Functorial Physics is background-independent and structurally economical.

\subsection{Loop Quantum Gravity}
Pros: background independence; Cons: difficulty unifying forces. Functorial Physics unifies forces through categorical coherence and naturally recovers classical limits.
