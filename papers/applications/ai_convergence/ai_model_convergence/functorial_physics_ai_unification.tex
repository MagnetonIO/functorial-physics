\begin{abstract}
In this treatise, we explore the remarkable convergence of state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) models on a unified formal framework for physics, herein termed \textit{Functorial Physics}. Drawing from category theory -- the mathematical language of structure and transformation -- this framework offers a universal formalism in which physical systems are encoded as objects and physical processes as morphisms within enriched categories. We trace the historical trajectory from particle colliders and quantum field theory to the modern synthesis of computational and physical semantics, represented in languages such as Haskell and proof assistants grounded in dependent type theory.

Recent developments in large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek, all independently reinforce the internal consistency, conceptual breadth, and explanatory power of Functorial Physics. This convergence suggests that AI may not only assist in but also \emph{verify} and \emph{amplify} the unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity without reliance on extra dimensions or unobservable constructs. We examine how functorial methods elegantly resolve the measurement problem, offer a compositional view of spacetime, and lend themselves naturally to quantum error correction, topological phases, and quantum computation.

Finally, we present a computational roadmap: translating categorical formulations into executable Haskell and dependently-typed code, bridging the gap between abstract theoretical physics and testable, scalable implementations. This work posits that Functorial Physics represents not merely a candidate for unification, but a transformation in how we formalize, compute, and reason about the physical universe -- with AI as both a tool and validator of its legitimacy.
