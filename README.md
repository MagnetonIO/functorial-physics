## Overview  

**Functorial Physics** is an open-source research initiative that explores the intersection of **quantum mechanics, general relativity**, and **higher category theory**. The project introduces a novel mathematical framework for modeling physical systems using **functors**, derived Hamiltonians, and tools from **topological quantum field theory (TQFT)** and **noncommutative geometry**.  

This repository hosts theoretical papers, code implementations, and supporting documentation aimed at building a cohesive, mathematically rigorous foundation for **quantum gravity, topological phases, and emergent spacetime**.

## Key Concepts  

- **Derived Hamiltonians** – Extensions of classical Hamiltonians incorporating gauge constraints, BRST symmetries, and topological corrections.  
- **Functorial Physics** – A categorical approach to modeling transformations between state spaces, observables, and phase spaces.  
- **Unified Evolution Equation (UEE)** – A generalization of the Schrödinger equation that encodes gravitational dynamics and quantum evolution.  
- **TQFT Integration** – Incorporates topological invariants into the Hamiltonian framework for emergent quantum behavior.  
- **Noncommutative Geometry** – Introduces deformed spacetime operators and quantum gravitational corrections.
